By default, sketches run in \"global mode\" to hide some of this complexity.\n\nIn global mode, a default instance of the `p5` class is created automatically. The default `p5` instance searches the web page's source code for declarations of system functions such as `setup()`, `draw()`, and `mousePressed()`, then attaches those functions to itself as methods. Calling a function such as `circle()` in global mode actually calls the default `p5` object's `pInst.circle()` method.\n\nIt's often helpful to isolate the code within sketches from the rest of the code on a web page. Two common use cases are web pages that use other JavaScript libraries and web pages with multiple sketches. \"Instance mode\" makes it easy to support both of these scenarios.\n\nInstance mode sketches support the same API as global mode sketches. They use a function to bundle, or encapsulate, an entire sketch. The function containing the sketch is then passed to the `p5()` constructor.\n\nThe first parameter, `sketch`, is a function that contains the sketch. For example, the statement `new p5(mySketch)` would create a new instance mode sketch from a function named `mySketch`.

For example, the corners of a rectangular image are mapped to the corners of a rectangle by default:\n\n``` // Apply the image as a texture. texture(img);\n\n// Draw the rectangle. rect(0, 0, 30, 50);\n\nIf the image in the code snippet above has dimensions of 300 x 500 pixels, the same result could be achieved as follows:\n\n`` // Apply the image as a texture. texture(img);\n\n// Draw the rectangle. beginShape();\n\n// Top-left. // u: 0, v: 0 vertex(0, 0, 0, 0, 0);\n\n// Top-right. // u: 300, v: 0 vertex(30, 0, 0, 300, 0);\n\n// Bottom-right. // u: 300, v: 500 vertex(30, 50, 0, 300, 500);\n\n// Bottom-left. // u: 0, v: 500 vertex(0, 50, 0, 0, 500);\n\nendShape();\n\n`textureMode()` changes the coordinate system for uv coordinates.\n\nThe parameter, `mode`, accepts two possible constants.

This can be helpful for using the same code for multiple images of different sizes. For example, the code snippet above could be rewritten as follows:\n\n ``// Set the texture mode to use normalized coordinates. textureMode(NORMAL);\n\n// Apply the image as a texture. texture(img);\n\n// Draw the rectangle. beginShape();\n\n// Top-left. // u: 0, v: 0 vertex(0, 0, 0, 0, 0);\n\n// Top-right. // u: 1, v: 0 vertex(30, 0, 0, 1, 0);\n\n// Bottom-right. // u: 1, v: 1 vertex(30, 50, 0, 1, 1);\n\n// Bottom-left. // u: 0, v: 1 vertex(0, 50, 0, 0, 1);\n\nendShape();\n\nBy default, `mode` is `IMAGE`, which scales uv coordinates to the dimensions of the image.
